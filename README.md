## Description
A collection of useful Bash scripts covering a range of common administrative
tasks. Some of these scripts are collected from other sources, in which case
the header of the file will contain the author and other relavent information.
In the case where a script has no header, it's because I'm lazy and didn't
bother to put one in every file (comments don't really do anything useful)
and are authored by me, for my own personal use.

Most of these scripts are the result of my never-ending desire to make my
life as easy as possible; still, I do take pride in my code. As such, please
make sure you include proper attribution if you decide to use any of these
in a project or production environment.

Note that these scripts were never really intended to be public, so do not
expect any warranties of any kind. Some of these scripts can be extremely
dangerous if used incorrectly and careless use could ruin your day.

## Contributing
If you make any changes, or add scripts please share them with me! I would love to add them to this repository.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
